# 🚀 DevOps Git Mastery Roadmap

This repository documents the essential Git knowledge required to transition from a beginner to a Senior DevOps Engineer. It emphasizes workflow, history management, and CI/CD integration.

## 🎯 My Goal

To master advanced Git concepts, clean history techniques, and automation (Git Hooks) to manage complex Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and modern CI/CD pipelines.

## 🗺️ Learning Phases

| Phase | Focus Area | Key Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Junior** | Day-to-Day Operations | `commit`, `status`, `revert`, Branching basics.  |
| **Phase 2: Mid-Level** | Clean History & Collaboration | `rebase -i` (squash), `cherry-pick`, Merge Strategies. |
| **Phase 3: Senior** | Architecture & Automation | Git Hooks, Submodules vs. Subtree, GitOps, Monorepo Strategy. |
